[Release] CargoDeck v1.0.0 - dynamic container inventory

CargoDesk is a web application that provides a dynamic dashboard for Docker Containers. Developed using Python, Flask, Gunicorn, and Gevent, it provides an easy-to-use interface for monitoring Docker instances and user-defined links. This dynamic functionality is made possible through Docker labels associated with running containers.

CargoDesk's simple web interface is define through environment variables and Docker labels, giving you full control over the displayed content. It is equipped to handle multiple instances running on different ports with unique label matches. To assist with debugging and monitoring of your Docker system, CargoDesk also includes a simple feature for error visualization when unexpected container behaviors are detected.

CargoDesk allows for additional customization through CSS and jinja2 templates. It can be configured to auto-refresh the page, with a specified interval between screen refreshes. With its dynamic nature, users can easily add or modify site components, such as icons, notes, URLs, and create entirely new sections as they are needed.

With its label-centric approach, configuration is easy and straightforward. Simply add or adjust the Docker labels on your containers, and CargoDesk adjusts accordingly. This offers an easy way to specify a container's role or link it to a specific service. You can even add multiple labels to a single container, allowing you to create complex and detailed interfaces without the need for manual coding.

The installation process of CargoDesk is straightforward. It comes with both a simple and an advanced docker-compose.yml file, which allows you to easily set up some test service. For a container to show up on CargoDesk, you only need to attach a single label.

CargoDesk's site layout includes the following elements: Site Header, Site Navigation, Section Header, Cards Section, Section Footer, and Site Footer. All of these are configured through labels on your containers, providing a highly customizable and flexible tool for Docker management.

CargoDesk is a powerful tool visualizing your Docker containers and associated web-interfaces. Whether you are an experienced Docker user or just getting started, CargoDesk provides a versatile, easy-to-use interface for your Docker ecosystem.

CargoDesk v1.0.0 introduced a number of new and renamed labels to increase the flexibility to contomize your inventory dashboard.
